    "\n",
    " - **Algorithms are fundamental to all areas of Computing**\n",
    "   - Algorithms are the backbone of computer science.\n",
    "     - Operating Systems\n",
    "     - Networking\n",
    "     - Cyber Security \n",
    "   - Algorithms and the computational perspective (the “computational lens”) has also been fruitfully applied to other areas, such as \n",
    "      - physics (e.g. quantum computing), \n",
    "      - economics (e.g. algorithmic gametheory), and \n",
    "      - biology (e.g. for studying evolutions, as a surprisingly efficient algorithm that searches the space of genotypes).\n",
    " - **Algorithms are useful**\n",
    "  - Much of the progress that has occurred in tech/industry is due to the dual developments of improved hardware (a la “Moore’s Law”)\n",
    "  - In fact, the faster computers get, the bigger the discrepancy is between what can be accomplished with fast algorithms vs what can be accomplished with slow algorithms.\n",
    "  - Industry needs to continue developing new algorithms for the problems of tomorrow, and you can help\n",
    "contribute.\n",
    " - **Algorithms are fun!**\n",
    "  - The design and analysis of algorithms requires a combination of creativity and mathematical precision. \n",
    "  - It is both an art and a science, and hopefully at least some of you will come to love this combination."
